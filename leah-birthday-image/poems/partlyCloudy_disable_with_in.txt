One Little Cloud Is Out To-day
by Annette Wynne
One little cloud is out to-day,
One little cloud, and a whole big sky for play—
What a big place for a little one,
Shine out, you big round sun,
Shine out and frighten the little lone cloud, I pray,
The sun shone out and the cloud ran away!
===
The Rainbow
by Christina Rossetti
Boats sail on the rivers,
And ships sail on the seas;
But clouds that sail across the sky
Are prettier far than these.

There are bridges on the rivers,
As pretty as you please;
But the bow that bridges heaven,
And overtops the trees,
And builds a road from earth to sky,
Is prettier far than these.

The Curly White Cloud Loves the Sky
by Annette Wynne
The curly white cloud loves the sky;
It stays up there—so high, so high,
Until the earth sends up a call,
"I'm thirsty, cloud, O, fall, please fall!"
The flower children all around
Cry up: "Dear cloud, come to the ground,"
And so, the cloud says: "Good-by, Sky,
I'll come again—so high, so high."
===
The Clouds
Clouds that wander through the sky,
Sometimes low and sometimes high;
In the darkness of the night,
In the sunshine warm and bright.
Ah! I wonder much if you
Have any useful work to do.
Yes, we're busy night and day,
As o'er the earth we take our way.
We are bearers of the rain
To the grasses, and flowers, and grain;
We guard you from the sun's bright rays,
In the sultry summer days.
===
The Cloud
by Percy Bysshe Shelley
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
The sweet buds every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
And whiten the green plains under,
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
And laugh as I pass in thunder.

The Little Cloud Comes Down
by Annette Wynne
The little spot of earth below
So pretty seemed the strong wind could not blow
The curly cloud away;
But right above, it lingered all the day;
And O, it got to like the spot so well,
It wanted to go down, and all at once—
Down, down, it fell,
With a pattering noise that was swift and loud,
But the earth was as glad as the curly cloud!

#        Clouds that hide the sun with showers
#        Are wet baskets full of flowers.
#
#        One is packed with poppies bright,
#        One with lillies inward white.

#        Beautiful cloud! with folds so soft and fair,
#        Swimming in the pure quiet air!
#        Thy fleeces bathed in sunlight, while below
#        Thy shadow o'er the vale moves slow;
#        Where, midst their labour, pause the reaper train
#        As cool it comes along the grain.

#        Ye clouds, who are the ornament of heaven,
#        Who give to it its gayest shadowings,
#        And its most awful glories; ye who roll
#        In the dark tempest, or at dewy evening
#        Hang low in tenderest beauty; ye who, ever
#        Changing your Protean aspects, now are gather'd,
#        Like fleecy piles, when the mid sun is brightest,
#        Even in the height of heaven, and there repose,

#        Do you remember, little cloud,
#        This morning when you lay—
#        A mist along the river—what
#        The waters had to say?
#
#        And how the many-coloured flowers
#        That on the margin grew,
#        All promised when the day was done
#        To leave their tints to you?

#        Where is my halcyon blue?
#        The grudging sky is overcast.
#        Where is my dowering sun?
#        A glory past.
#
#        Nay, soul, thy daily sky
#        Unfading spirit light must win,
#        Dark days thy sunshine glow
#        Ah bright within!

#
#        A little cloud stood lonely
#        Amid the evening sky;
#        Doubting and fearful waiting there,—
#        No other cloudlet nigh.
#
#        Poor faint and weakling timid lamb
#        Far wandered from the fold,
#        The shepherd never missed at all,—
#        Forgotten in the cold.
#
#        My cloudlet wavered on the blue,
#        The heaven-meadow scanned
#        For hope of any cloudy friend
#        With misty, beckoning hand;
#
#        A moment longer waited,
#        Abandoned by the day;
#        Then, like a little spirit cloud,
#        He faded quite away.

#        Down the blue night the unending columns press
#        In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,
#        Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow
#        Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.
#        Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,
#        And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,
#        As who would pray good for the world, but know
#        Their benediction empty as they bless.
#
#        They say that the Dead die not, but remain
#        Near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.
#        I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,
#        In wise majestic melancholy train,
#        And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,
#        And men, coming and going on the earth.

#        There's a cloud on my life’s horizon
#        wonderful shape and hue,
#        Like the feathery down of a snow-drift
#        ’Tis dimpled with changeful blue.
#        I gaze on its shadowy outline
#        And drink in the calm of the skies,
#        Till I fancy it floats out of heaven,
#        As an angel in disguise.

#        The sky is full of clouds to-day,
#        And idly, to and fro,
#        Like sheep across the pasture, they
#        Across the heavens go.
#        I hear the wind with merry noise
#        Around the housetops sweep,
#        And dream it is the shepherd boys,—
#        They're driving home their sheep.
#
#        The clouds move faster now; and see!
#        The west is red and gold.
#        Each sheep seems hastening to be
#        The first within the fold.
#        I watch them hurry on until
#        The blue is clear and deep,
#        And dream that far beyond the hill
#        The shepherds fold their sheep.
#
#        Then in the sky the trembling stars
#        Like little flowers shine out,
#        While Night puts up the shadow bars,
#        And darkness falls about.

The Small Clouds Nestled in the Sky
by Annette Wynne
The small clouds nestled in the sky
And hid the sun;
But soon the blustering wind rushed by,
And chased them every one,
And swept the sky so neat and clean
That not a single speck was seen.
