        Come we to the summer, to the summer we will come,
        For the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of bloom,
        And the crow is on the oak a-building of her nest,
        And love is burning diamonds in my true lover's breast;
        She sits beneath the whitethorn a-plaiting of her hair,
        And I will to my true lover with a fond request repair;
        I will look upon her face, I will in her beauty rest,
        And lay my aching weariness upon her lovely breast.

        The clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom of May,
        The merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day,
        And the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest
        In the whitethorn bush where I will lean upon my lover's breast;
        I'll lean upon her breast and I'll whisper in her ear
        That I cannot get a wink o'sleep for thinking of my dear;
        I hunger at my meat and I daily fade away
        Like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day.

    Summer Evening
    by John Clare

        The frog half fearful jumps across the path,
        And little mouse that leaves its hole at eve
        Nimbles with timid dread beneath the swath;
        My rustling steps awhile their joys deceive,
        Till past, and then the cricket sings more strong,
        And grasshoppers in merry moods still wear
        The short night weary with their fretting song.
        Up from behind the molehill jumps the hare,
        Cheat of his chosen bed, and from the bank
        The yellowhammer flutters in short fears
        From off its nest hid in the grasses rank,
        And drops again when no more noise it hears.
        Thus nature's human link and endless thrall,
        Proud man, still seems the enemy of all.

        The night is dewy as a maiden's mouth,
        The skies are bright as are a maiden's eyes,
        Soft as a maiden's breath the wind that flies
        Up from the perfumed bosom of the South.

        Like sentinels, the pines stand in the park;
        And hither hastening, like rakes that roam,
        With lamps to light their wayward footsteps home,
        The fireflies come stagg'ring down the dark.

        Now swarthy Summer, by rude health embrowned,
        Precedence takes of rosy fingered Spring;
        And laughing Joy, with wild flowers prank'd, and crown'd,
        A wild and giddy thing,
        And Health robust, from every care unbound,
        Come on the zephyr's wing,
        And cheer the toiling clown.

        The afternoon grew darkening from the west;
        A hush fell on the air, and in the trees;
        The huddled birds pronounced their prophecies;
        The flowers bent their heads as if to rest
        Now that the tide of the sun's golden seas
        In one long wave swept off the earth's wide breast.
        Up sprung deft shadowy patterns by degrees,
        And nature's face her soul made manifest.

        It is a sultry day; the sun has drank
        The dew that lay upon the morning grass;
        There is no rustling in the lofty elm
        That canopies my dwelling, and its shade
        Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint
        And interrupted murmur of the bee,
        Settling on the sick flowers, and then again
        Instantly on the wing. The plants around
        Feel the too potent fervours: the tall maize
        Rolls up its long green leaves; the clover droops
        Its tender foliage, and declines its blooms.

    Midsummer
    by William Cullen Bryant

        A power is on the earth and in the air,
        From which the vital spirit shrinks afraid,
        And shelters him, in nooks of deepest shade,
        From the hot steam and from the fiery glare.
        Look forth upon the earth—her thousand plants
        Are smitten, even the dark sun-loving maize
        Faints in the field beneath the torrid blaze;
        The herd beside the shaded fountain pants;
        For life is driven from all the landscape brown;
        The bird has sought his tree, the snake his den,
        The trout floats dead in the hot stream, and men
        Drop by the sun-stroke in the populous town;
        As if the Day of Fire had dawned and Sent
        Its deadly breath into the firmament.

    Summer
    by James Russell Lowell. Excerpt from The Vision of Sir Launfal.

        Now is the high tide of the year,
        And whatever of life hath ebbed away
        Comes flooding back with a ripply cheer,
        Into every bare inlet and creek and bay.
        We may shut our eyes, but we can not help knowing
        That skies are clear and grass is growing;
        The breeze comes whispering in our ear,
        That dandelions are blossoming near,
        That maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing,
        That the river is bluer than the sky,
        That the robin is plastering his house hard by;
        And if the breeze kept the good news back
        For other couriers we should not lack;
        We could guess it all by yon heifer's lowing,—
        And hark! how clear bold chanticleer,
        Warmed with the new wine of the year,
        Tells all in his lusty crowing.

        I must away to the wooded hills and vales,
        Where broad, slow streams flow cool and silently
        And idle barges flap their listless sails.

        And green fields wait for me.

        Charm of the vibrant, white September sun—
        How tower the firs to take it, tranced and still!
        Their scant ranks crown the pale, round pasture-hill,
        And watch, far down, the austere waters run
        Their circuit thro' the serious marshes dun.
        No bird-call stirs the blue; but strangely thrill
        The blunt faced, brown cicada's wing-notes shrill,
        A web of silver o'er the silence spun.

        To make the rocks skip o'er the waters smooth
        And see the frogs plunge from the water's edge,
        And hear the gentle cooing of the dove
        Among the elms and from the distant hedge.

        The birds laugh loud and long together
        When Fashion's followers speed away
        At the first cool breath of autumn weather.
        Why, this is the time, cry the birds, to stay!
        When the deep calm sea and the deep sky over
        Both look their passion through sun-kissed space,
        As a blue-eyed maid and her blue-eyed lover
        Might each gaze into the other's face.

        Oh! this is the time when careful spying
        Discovers the secrets Nature knows.
        You find when the butterflies plan for flying
        (Before the thrush or the blackbird goes),
        You see some day by the water's edges
        A brilliant border of red and black;
        And then off over the hills and hedges
        It flutters away on the summer's track.

        The shy little sumacs, in lonely places,
        Bowed all summer with dust and heat,
        Like clean-clad children with rain-washed faces,
        Are dressed in scarlet from head to feet.
        And never a flower had the boastful summer,
        In all the blossoms that decked her sod,
        So royal hued as that later comer
        The purple chum of the goldenrod.

        Some chill grey dawn you note with grieving
        That the King of Autumn is on his way.
        You see, with a sorrowful, slow believing,
        How the wanton woods have gone astray,
        They wear the stain of bold caresses,
        Of riotous revels with old King Frost;
        They dazzle all eyes with their gorgeous dresses,
        Nor care that their green young leaves are lost.

        A wet wind blows from the East one morning,
        The wood's gay garments looked draggled out.
        You hear a sound, and your heart takes warning―
        The birds are planning their winter route.
        They wheel and settle and scold and wrangle,
        Their tempers are ruffled, their voices loud;
        Then whirr and away in a feathered tangle,
        To fade in the south like a passing cloud.

        Envoi A songless wood stripped bare of glory―
        A sodden moor that is black and brown;
        The year has finished its last love-story:
        Oh! let us away to the gay bright town.
