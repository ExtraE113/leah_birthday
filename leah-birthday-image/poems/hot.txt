A Summer's Night
by Paul Laurence Dunbar
The night is dewy as a maiden's mouth,
The skies are bright as are a maiden's eyes,
Soft as a maiden's breath the wind that flies
Up from the perfumed bosom of the South.
Like sentinels, the pines stand in the park;
And hither hastening, like rakes that roam,
With lamps to light their wayward footsteps home,
The fireflies come stagg'ring down the dark.

Summer Images
by John Clare
Now swarthy Summer, by rude health embrowned,
Precedence takes of rosy fingered Spring;
And laughing Joy, with wild flowers prank'd, and crown'd,
A wild and giddy thing,
And Health robust, from every care unbound,
Come on the zephyr's wing,
And cheer the toiling clown.
===
A Summer Night
by Elizabeth Stoddard
I feel the breath of the summer night,
Aromatic fire:
The trees, the vines, the flowers are astir
With tender desire.
===
Rain in Summer
by William Stanley Braithwaite
The afternoon grew darkening from the west;
A hush fell on the air, and in the trees;
The huddled birds pronounced their prophecies;
The flowers bent their heads as if to rest
Now that the tide of the sun's golden seas
In one long wave swept off the earth's wide breast.
Up sprung deft shadowy patterns by degrees,
And nature's face her soul made manifest.
===
A Summer Longing
by George Arnold
I must away to the wooded hills and vales,
Where broad, slow streams flow cool and silently
And idle barges flap their listless sails.
For me the summer sunset glows and pales,
And green fields wait for me.
===
A Summer Day
by George Cooper
This is the way the morning dawns:
Rosy tints on flowers and trees,
Winds that wake the birds and bees,
Dewdrops on the fields and lawns—
This is the way the morning dawns.

A something in a summer's day
by Emily Dickinson
A something in a summer's day,
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
Which solemnizes me.
===
As imperceptibly as grief
by Emily Dickinson
As imperceptibly as grief
The summer lapsed away, —
Too imperceptible, at last,
To seem like perfidy.
===
I know a place where summer strives
by Emily Dickinson
I know a place where summer strives
With such a practised frost,
She each year leads her daisies back,
Recording briefly, "Lost."
===
Nature's Changes
by Emily Dickinson
The springtime's pallid landscape
Will glow like bright bouquet,
Though drifted deep in parian
The village lies to-day.
===
Summer's Armies
by Emily Dickinson
Some rainbow coming from the fair!
Some vision of the world Cashmere
I confidently see!
Or else a peacock's purple train,
Feather by feather, on the plain
Fritters itself away!
===
The bee is not afraid of me
by Emily Dickinson
The bee is not afraid of me,
I know the butterfly;
The pretty people in the woods
Receive me cordially.
===
Summer's Obsequies
by Emily Dickinson
The gentian weaves her fringes,
The maple's loom is red.
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.
===
Aftermath
by Emily Dickinson
The murmuring of bees has ceased;
But murmuring of some
Posterior, prophetic,
Has simultaneous come, —

The Summer Shower
Thomas Buchanan Read
Before the stout harvesters falleth the grain,
As when the strong stormwind is reaping the plain,
And loiters the boy in the briery lane;
But yonder aslant comes the silvery rain,
Like a long line of spears brightly burnished and tall.
===
A Remembrance
by Bliss Carman
Here in lovely New England
When summer is come, a sea-turn
Flutters a page of remembrance
In the volume of long ago.
===
Midsummer in the Catskills
by John Burroughs
The strident hum of sickle-bar,
Like giant insect heard afar,
Is on the air again;
I see the mower where he rides
Above the level grassy tides
That flood the meadow plain.
===
The Cicada in the Firs
by Sir Charles George Douglas Roberts
Charm of the vibrant, white September sun—
How tower the firs to take it, tranced and still!
Their scant ranks crown the pale, round pasture-hill,
And watch, far down, the austere waters run
Their circuit thro' the serious marshes dun.
No bird-call stirs the blue; but strangely thrill
The blunt faced, brown cicada's wing-notes shrill,
A web of silver o'er the silence spun.
===
Spring and Summer
by Kate Slaughter McKinney
I heard a footstep on the hill,
The little brook began to trill,
I looked—a sweet and childlike face,
Reflected like a blooming vase,
Was smiling from the water clear,
With buttercups behind her ear.
===
Summer is Coming
by Dora
"Summer is coming!" the soft breezes whisper;
"Summer is coming!" the glad birdies sing.
Summer is coming—I hear her quick footsteps;
Take your last look at the beautiful Spring.
===
Summer
by Ellen P. Allerton
The trailing skirts of the summer
Have swept away to the south—
A blast came down from the northland
And kissed her on the mouth.
===
Summer
by Christina Rossetti
Winter is cold-hearted,
Spring is yea and nay,
Autumn is a weathercock
Blown every way:
Summer days for me
When every leaf is on its tree;
===
The Summer's Tale Is Told
by Ellen P. Allerton
The twilight ends; the last faint crimson stain
Has faded from the west; the deep blue sky,
Deeper and darker grows, and once again
God's lamps are lighted in the dome on high.
Above yon distant swell, where trailing clouds
Hung low and black at noon,
Now, round and red, from out their torn white shrouds,
Steps forth the harvest moon.
===
An Evening's Stroll
by Ed Blair
When July's sun has spent her fierceness on
The sweltering earth; I love to ramble then
Along the narrow banks of dear Elm Creek
And be for one short hour a boy again.
To make the rocks skip o'er the waters smooth
And see the frogs plunge from the water's edge,
And hear the gentle cooing of the dove
Among the elms and from the distant hedge.
===
Summer Is O'er
by Ed Blair
Old Winter's nigh—the landscape tells me so,
The trees are bare, their dead leaves piled below;
Between bare banks the chilly waters flow.
The Summer's o'er.
===
Bed in Summer
by Robert Louis Stevenson
In winter I get up at night
And dress by yellow candle-light.
In summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.
===
Summer and You
by Ruby Archer
Summer is dead—and yet, my own,
It lives in you.
You are my flowers, and sunny hours,
And skies all blue.
===
Summer Sun
by Robert Louis Stevenson
Great is the sun, and wide he goes
Through empty heaven without repose;
And in the blue and glowing days
More thick than rain he showers his rays.
===
Summer Glory
by Annette Wynne
Is it true
That you
Are indeed
The shriveled seed
In spring I buried underground
Not a bit of green around?
===
Early Summer
by Ellwood Roberts
Full of joy is early Summer,
Growth and warmth and golden light;
Every day is crowned with beauty,
Full of loveliness the night.
Dazzling sunshine brings the roses,
Fills the whole bright world with bloom;
Day and night rejoice together,
Banished now are doubt and gloom.
===
The Summer's Message
by Annie Armstrong
What is the message the Summer brings?
The fair new Summer of bud and bloom,
That sweeps from the south upon airy wings,
Filling the earth with a sweet perfume;
Listen! From every tree a voice;
The birds are singing their song, "Rejoice!"
