Rain
by Robert Louis Stevenson
The rain is raining all around,
It falls on field and tree,
It rains on the umbrellas here,
And on the ships at sea.

The Rain
by Ruby Archer

He is coming the gentle Rain,
Riding his steed, the wind;
And over the dusty plain
Where grasses thirstily pined
Floats a sigh—
"He is nigh!"

And the thunder grumbles his name
To the lightning's questioning glance;
While the air, like a restless flame,
Quivers and glows and pants
With the cry—
"He is nigh!"

AFTER THE RAIN.
by Thomas Bailey Aldrich
THE rain has ceased, and in my room
The sunshine pours an airy flood;
And on the church's dizzy vane
The ancient Cross is bathed in blood.
From out the dripping ivy-leaves,
Antiquely carven, gray and high,
A dormer, facing westward, looks
Upon the village like an eye:
And now it glimmers in the sun,
A square of gold, a disk, a speck:
And in the belfry sits a Dove
With purple ripples on her neck.

After Rain
by Alfred Noyes
LISTEN! On sweetening air
The blackbird growing bold
Flings out, where green boughs glisten,
Three splashes of wild gold.
Daughter of April, hear;
And hear, O barefoot boy!
That carol of wild sweet water
Has washed the world with joy.
Glisten, O fragrant earth
Assoiled by heaven anew,
And O, ye lovers, listen,
With eyes that glisten, too.

Summer Rain
by Edmund Clarence Stedman
Yestermorn the air was dry
As the winds of Araby,
While the sun, with pitiless heat,
Glared upon the glaring street,
And the meadow fountains sealed,
Till the people everywhere,
And the cattle in the field,
And the birds in middle air,
And the thirsty little flowers,
Sent to heaven a fainting prayer
For the blessed summer showers.
