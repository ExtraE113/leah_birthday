    One Little Cloud Is Out To-day
    by Annette Wynne

        One little cloud is out to-day,
        One little cloud, and a whole big sky for play—
        What a big place for a little one,
        Shine out, you big round sun,
        Shine out and frighten the little lone cloud, I pray,
        The sun shone out and the cloud ran away!

        Boats sail on the rivers,
        And ships sail on the seas;
        But clouds that sail across the sky
        Are prettier far than these.

    The Curly White Cloud Loves the Sky

        The curly white cloud loves the sky;
        It stays up there—so high, so high,
        Until the earth sends up a call,
        "I'm thirsty, cloud, O, fall, please fall!"

        "Clouds that wander through the sky,
        Sometimes low and sometimes high;
        In the darkness of the night,
        In the sunshine warm and bright.
        Ah! I wonder much if you
        Have any useful work to do."

        A cloud lay cradled near the setting sun,
        A gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow;
        Long had I watched the glory moving on,
        O'er the still radiance of the lake below:
        Tranquil its spirit seemed, and floated slow,
        E'en in its very motion there was rest,
        While every breath of eve that chanced to blow,
        Wafted the traveler to the beauteous west.

        I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
        From the seas and the streams;
        I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
        In their noonday dreams.
        From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
        The sweet buds every one,
        When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
        As she dances about the sun.
        I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
        And whiten the green plains under,
        And then again I dissolve it in rain,
        And laugh as I pass in thunder.

    The Little Cloud Comes Down
    by Annette Wynne

        The little spot of earth below
        So pretty seemed the strong wind could not blow
        The curly cloud away;
        But right above, it lingered all the day;
        And O, it got to like the spot so well,
        It wanted to go down, and all at once—
        Down, down, it fell,
        With a pattering noise that was swift and loud,
        But the earth was as glad as the curly cloud!

        Clouds that hide the sun with showers
        Are wet baskets full of flowers.

        One is packed with poppies bright,
        One with lillies inward white.

        Beautiful cloud! with folds so soft and fair,
        Swimming in the pure quiet air!
        Thy fleeces bathed in sunlight, while below
        Thy shadow o'er the vale moves slow;
        Where, midst their labour, pause the reaper train
        As cool it comes along the grain.

        Ye clouds, who are the ornament of heaven,
        Who give to it its gayest shadowings,
        And its most awful glories; ye who roll
        In the dark tempest, or at dewy evening
        Hang low in tenderest beauty; ye who, ever
        Changing your Protean aspects, now are gather'd,
        Like fleecy piles, when the mid sun is brightest,
        Even in the height of heaven, and there repose,

        Do you remember, little cloud,
        This morning when you lay—
        A mist along the river—what
        The waters had to say?

        Where is my halcyon blue?
        The grudging sky is overcast.
        Where is my dowering sun?
        A glory past.

        A little cloud stood lonely
        Amid the evening sky;
        Doubting and fearful waiting there,—
        No other cloudlet nigh.

        Down the blue night the unending columns press
        In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,
        Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow
        Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.
        Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,
        And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,
        As who would pray good for the world, but know
        Their benediction empty as they bless.

        There's a cloud on my life’s horizon
        wonderful shape and hue,
        Like the feathery down of a snow-drift
        ’Tis dimpled with changeful blue.
        I gaze on its shadowy outline
        And drink in the calm of the skies,
        Till I fancy it floats out of heaven,
        As an angel in disguise.

        The sky is full of clouds to-day,
        And idly, to and fro,
        Like sheep across the pasture, they
        Across the heavens go.
        I hear the wind with merry noise
        Around the housetops sweep,
        And dream it is the shepherd boys,—
        They're driving home their sheep.

    The Small Clouds Nestled in the Sky

        The small clouds nestled in the sky
        And hid the sun;
        But soon the blustering wind rushed by,
        And chased them every one,
        And swept the sky so neat and clean
        That not a single speck was seen.
